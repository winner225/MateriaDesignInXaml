The library is compiled with VS 2015/C#6.0 to target .Net 4.5, which is the version you will find in the Nuget package.

# .Net 4.0

There is a .Net 4.0 branch (net40) which was last updated just after the release of version 1.2, but **.Net 4.0 is no longer supported**.

I don't have the time to keep this up-to-date but I will accept pull requests onto this branch if anyone else wants to refresh it from master.

* Branch: https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit/tree/net40

# Visual Studio Versions

To compile the source you will need Visual Studio 2015.  However, the compiled binaries *can* be used in Visual Studio 2012/2013 (pull in via nuget or reference manually).

# Pre-Compiled Demo

If you are using < Visual Studio 2015 you can still see the demo (which is part of the main source code) in action. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit/releases) page and look for a compiled version of the demo, e.g. Material.Design.Demo.1.3.zip
