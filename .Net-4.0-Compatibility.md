The library is compiled with VS 2015/C#6.0 to target .Net 4.5, which is the version you will find in the Nuget package.

There is a .Net 4.0 branch (net40) which was last updated just after the release of version 1.2, but **.Net 4.0 is no longer supported**.

I don't have the time to keep this up-to-date but I will accept pull requests onto this branch if anyone else wants to refresh it from master.

* Branch: https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit/tree/net40
