The library is compiled with VS 2015/C#6.0 to target .Net 4.5, which is the version you will find in the Nuget package.

However. there is a .Net4.0 branch, which is currently updated from trunk at every release.  You can compile this yourself, or - easier - you can manually download the .Net 4.0 binaries (as a zip) from the GitHub release.
